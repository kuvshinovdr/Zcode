# Zcode

## Purpose

A small programming language that may be possibly used as a scripting language in C++-programs. 

## Properties

* A program is an infix-form expression.
* Static typing with possibly dynamic checks for enabling contracts.
* Simple static type inference.

## Lexemes

Comments start with // and end with the new-line character (one-line comments only):

```
not a comment // A comment
not a comment
```

Identifiers must start with a "letter" or _ and then may also contain digit characters.
